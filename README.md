## Responsibilities of a Development Team Lead
Following are some useful tasks for Development Team Leads to take on and own. This is by no means an exhaustive list, or a required list, but rather a list of recommendations. Your unique work environment, team structure and team makeup will determine which of these items are useful or necessary.

* Schedule and maintain recurring 1:1 Meetings with your team members
  * Understand their work/life balance
  * Understand their career goals and help to set new goals
  * Understand their motivations and objectives
  * Empathize with their issues and listen to their problems
  * Communicate issues to management, but only with team members' blessing
  * Encourage the use of PTO if it's not being used
* Schedule and maintain daily stand-ups if they're not otherwise happening
  * Actually stand up.
  * What did you do yesterday?
  * What are you doing today?
  * Do you have any blockers?
  * No side-discussions, save those for post-standup
* Work to clear blockers for your team
  * Own and resolve access/connection/account problems
  * Own and facilitate the resolution of human dependency issues

  * Ask "Can this meeting be replaced by an email?"
  * Ask "Can I collect information and stand-in for people in this meeting?"
* Work to improve processes
  * Does deployment take 2 days? Work to cut it in half, then in half again.
