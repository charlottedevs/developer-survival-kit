## Responsibilities of a Developer
Following are some useful traits and practices for Developers. This is by no means an exhaustive list, and it's by no means a required list, but rather a collection of recommendations. Your workplace will determine your required responsibilities and the things you must do to maintain your position in the organization. This is a list of things you should do as a good Develpment Team Member or a citizen of your organization.

* Be a team player. Follow your team's conventions and processes
* Be vocal. Communicate frequently: particularly blockers, risk or other inhibitors to progress
* Be constructive. Offering criticism without solutions is poor form
* Be helpful. You are part of a larger team working toward a common goal.
* Be mindful. When you write code, leave it in the condition you would hope to find it in.
* Be open. Your ideas are good and important, but so are the ideas of others. You don't know everything.
* Be aware. Listen in meetings and to your team members. Information is everywhere.
* Be present. Whether you're in the office or remote, participate in discussions, meetings and other events.
* Be responsible. Deliver on your promises, set realistic expectations and communicate when you cannot meet your goals.
* Be flexible. Process is good, but progress is better. Sometimes you have to work around process to make progress.
