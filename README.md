## Responsibilities of a Developer
Following are some useful traits and practices for Developers. This is by no means an exhaustive list, and it's by no means a required list, but rather a collection of recommendations. Your workplace will determine your required responsibilities and the things you must do to maintain your position in the organization. This is a list of things you should do as a good Development Team Member or a citizen of your organization.

* __Be a team player.__ Follow your team's conventions and processes
* __Be vocal.__ Communicate frequently: particularly blockers, risk or other inhibitors to progress
* __Be constructive.__ Offering criticism without solutions is poor form
* __Be helpful.__ You are part of a larger team working toward a common goal.
* __Be mindful.__ When you write code, leave it in the condition you would hope to find it in.
* __Be open.__ Your ideas are good and important, but so are the ideas of others. You don't know everything.
* __Be aware.__ Listen in meetings and to your team members. Information is everywhere.
* __Be present.__ Whether you're in the office or remote, participate in discussions, meetings and other events.
* __Be responsible.__ Deliver on your promises, set realistic expectations and communicate when you cannot meet your goals.
* __Be flexible.__ Process is good, but progress is better. Sometimes you have to work around process to make progress.

## Responsibilities of a Junior Developer
As a junior, your primary role is to learn the domain knowledge of your workplace as well as tricks of the trade from your fellow developers. This is a list of recommendations similar to that of the developer, but with a focus on how it applies to you.

* __Be a team player.__ Follow your team's conventions and processes. However, as a junior, you should ask questions. If you don't know something, you should be asking.
* __Be vocal.__ Give your opinions. Ask questions. Communicate your blockers. Never assume you have nothing to contribute, but make sure you are valuing the experience of others as well.
* __Be constructive.__ Learn to ask questions in a positive manner and find ways to give criticism paired with solutions. Learning to accept these as well from others will go a long way.
* __Be helpful.__ Try things out. Experience things you aren't familiar with. This will help you learn and help build your confidence. Find those among your team that are most encouraging and feed off of that.
* __Be mindful.__ You are learning to write code. Ask for pattern advice. Copy patterns present in the codebase for practice and consistency. Ask questions about why a decision was made.
* __Be open.__ Please do bring your ideas forward. This will help you learn and bring new things to the table. Learn to be open to the ideas of others at the same time. This dance is hard. Don't sweat it, but do learn it.
* __Be aware.__ Listen. Gather information. Then ask questions about what you're missing.
* __Be present.__ Show up to things. Speak up in meetings and discussions. These things will help you learn and will help others trust you.
* __Be responsible.__ You will rarely be asked at this stage to estimate, but be careful that you don't overpromise things. Communicate blockers and anything that you don't understand.
* __Be flexible.__ Right now, you probably should avoid breaking the rules. If you think that you need to get around process to make progress, ask for some advice and help. Maybe someone knows another way! Maybe you were right. Discussion will help vet this out. Above all, be willing to jump in and help out in whatever way you're asked. Be willing to play whatever role your team needs.
